# Aquario
## What is Aquario?
Aquario is planned to be a series of overhaul mods that vastly change the fundamentals of Factorio. The mod(s) are heavily inspired by the likes of Seablock and Pyblock, however, only in concept and idea.

## What's in store for Aquario?
It is far too early in development to discern the fate of Aquario, let alone what is in store for the main mod and subsequent mods. However, without a doubt, *water* is the primary resource.

## Ideas
The [ideas](https://github.com/jaythom2723/Aquario/blob/main/IDEAS.md) file, will go over things that are actively being designed as well as provide a bit more context than this [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZkqEqgm3ItNDvxcVqbjngmfc1gUmM0XwPo3I8ARKp_k/edit?usp=sharing).

## To-Do
A global [todo list](https://github.com/jaythom2723/Aquario/blob/main/TODO.md) is where any and all features that are *planned* to be implemented will go. As opposed to working with a Trello, this file will keep track of what's in progress, what needs testing, and what is completed.
