# Ideas
This file describes what Aquario is going to be in essence, concept, and what it should look like in-game.
Anything described in this file is to be ***assumed*** to change sooner or later.

# Additional Aquario Mods
## Aquario Farming & Husbandry
Farming & Husbandry, as the name implies, is all about farming and husbandry, *shocker*. The mod will have alternative means of producing power, different ways of acquring raw resources like coal, iron oxide ore, and copper oxide ore and much much more. The husbandry side of the mod will primarily focus on raising new life on your little island and using their products as new materials to further increase the complexity of the game, and the fun involved (hopefully).

## Aquario Biochem
Biochem, unlike Farming & Husbandry, will mess with the idea of bacteria, cellular cloning, and many other Biological and Chemical reactions. This mod is intended to use a large amounts of fluids and gasses in order to make the game longer, but also more interesting (hopefully) in the process.

The idea of Biochem is to make Multicellular life-forms that can help you in producing various items, fluids, gasses, and more

## Aquario Advanced Circuitry
As the name implies, greatly enhances the production of circuits, making the production chains longer and more "hardcore". Definitely a mod for those who wish to extend their game a few hours.
