# Ideas
This file describes what Aquario is going to be in essence, concept, and what it should look like in-game.
Anything described in this file is to be ***assumed*** to change sooner or later.

# Aquario Main
- experiment with different pollutant types
    - sulfur geysers?
    - atmospheric hotspots???

*research the following bullshit*

# Additional Aquario Mods
## Aquario Farming & Husbandry
Farming & Husbandry, as the name implies, is all about farming and husbandry, *shocker*. The mod will have alternative means of producing power, different ways of acquring raw resources like coal, iron oxide ore, and copper oxide ore and much much more. The husbandry side of the mod will primarily focus on raising new life on your little island and using their products as new materials to further increase the complexity of the game, and the fun involved (hopefully).

## Aquario Biochem
Biochem, unlike Farming & Husbandry, will mess with the idea of bacteria, cellular cloning, and many other Biological and Chemical reactions. This mod is intended to use a large amounts of fluids and gasses in order to make the game longer, but also more interesting (hopefully) in the process.

The idea of Biochem is to make Multicellular life-forms that can help you in producing various items, fluids, gasses, and more

## Aquario Advanced Circuitry
As the name implies, greatly enhances the production of circuits, making the production chains longer and more "hardcore". Definitely a mod for those who wish to extend their game a few hours.

# Production Chains
## Stone (Tier 1)
Sea Water from an Offshore Pump goes into a Mixing Drum, Soil from a Soil Gatherer also goes into the Mixing Drum. This mixing process forms Dirty Sea Water.
The Dirty Sea Water is then filtered in a Filtration Drum, where it yields Stone and Dirty Unmineralized Sea Water.

## Silica (Tier 1)
Sea Water from an Offshore Pump goes into a Mixing Drum, Soil from a Soil Gatherer also goes into the Mixing Drum. This mixing process forms Dirty Sea Water.
The Dirty Sea Water is then filtered in a Filtration Drum, where it yields Stone and Dirty Unmineralized Sea Water.
The Stone is then put into a Crusher, which yields Silica.

## Coal (Tier 0)
Player finds wood in the water and puts it into a furnace to make coal

## Coal (Tier 1)
Sea Water from an Offshore Pump goes into a Mixing Drum, Soil from a Soil Gatherer also goes into the Mixing Drum. This mixing process forms Dirty Sea Water.
The Dirty Sea Water is then filtered in a Filtration Drum, where it yields Stone and Dirty Unmineralized Sea Water.
The Dirty Unmineralized Sea Water gets filtered with Silica in a Filtration Drum, to yield Algae Culture, Dirty Silica, and Waste Waster.
Algae Culture goes into an Algae Cultivator to yield Algae
Algae is put into a furnace and gets burned into Coal

## Iron Plate (Tier 1)
Sea Water from an Offshore Pump goes into a Filtration Drum to yield Water and Salt.
Water goes into a Mixing Drum and Soil from a Soil Gatherer also goes into the Mixing Drum to yield Dirty Water.
The Dirty Water goes into a Crystalizer to yield Mineral Water
Mineral Water goes into a Filtration Drum with Silica to yield Raw Iron Oxide Ore, Raw Copper Oxide Ore, Dirty Silica, and Waste Water

## Copper Plate (Tier 1)
Sea Water from an Offshore Pump goes into a Filtration Drum to yield Water and Salt.
Water goes into a Mixing Drum and Soil from a Soil Gatherer also goes into the Mixing Drum to yield Dirty Water.
The Dirty Water goes into a Crystalizer to yield Mineral Water
Mineral Water goes into a Filtration Drum with Silica to yield Raw Iron Oxide Ore, Raw Copper Oxide Ore, Dirty Silica, and Waste Water

## Impure Energy Crystal (Tier 1)
Sea Water from an Offshore Pump goes into a Mixing Drum. Soil from a Soil Gatherer goes into the Mixing Drum as well. This yields Dirty Sea Water.
The Dirty Sea Water goes into an Evaporator to form Dirty Salt.
The Dirty Salt is put into a crystalizer to make Impure Energy Crystals.

## Basic Energy Crystal (Tier 1)
TBD
